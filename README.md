## Introduction

The Diamond Price Predictor is a machine learning application designed to provide accurate price predictions for diamonds. It leverages various features of diamonds to estimate their market value. The project aims to assist jewelers, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions based on predicted prices.

## Features

- Predict diamond prices based on multiple features.
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit.
- Visualization of data and prediction results.
- Easy-to-use and intuitive design.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diamond-price-predictor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd diamond-price-predictor
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser. You can then interact with the app to predict diamond prices.

## Model

The model used in this project is a regression model trained on a dataset of diamonds. The features used for prediction include:

- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Depth
- Table
- X (Length)
- Y (Width)
- Z (Depth)

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is publicly available and contains detailed information about diamonds, including their characteristics and prices.
